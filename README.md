##Block Out

[Live Game](http://steve-deluca.me/BlockOut "Block Out")

Block Out is a puzzle game where the player's goal is to shift the positions of rectangular blocks on a
game board in order to free up a target block and move it toward the exit point. Blocks can have different lengths
and can only be moved in one direction. The difficulty increases with the completion of each level.

The player can jump to any level and has the option of reseting the entire board to it's original state for that
particular level.

The game was built using EaselJS and vanilla JavaScript
